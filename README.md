## My process

### Technology Used

This project was built using the following frontend technologies and methodologies:

- **Semantic HTML5 markup:** To provide a clear and meaningful structure to the content.
- **CSS custom properties:** To efficiently manage and reuse style values throughout the project.
- **Flexbox:** To create flexible and responsive layouts.
- **SASS:** To write CSS more efficiently with nested rules, variables, and mixins.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier):** To create modular, reusable, and maintainable CSS code.
- **Mobile-first workflow:** To ensure a better user experience on smaller screens and devices.

### Useful resources

- [SASS documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation): The official SASS documentation serve as a valuable reference for understanding the syntax, features, and capabilities of SASS.
